   - Implemented bee wing flapping animation effects
   - Optimized background display, resolving the fragmented appearance of background images
   - Fixed missile auto-tracking functionality
   - Added background music and optimized sound effects

3. User Experience Improvements
   - Reduced the font size of status displays in the game interface

   - Updated README documentation to be more concise and consistent

4. Cleanup Work
   - Deleted unnecessary documentation files and scripts
